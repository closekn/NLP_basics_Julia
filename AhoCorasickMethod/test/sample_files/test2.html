<h1> Document </h1>
The following document is taken <b>from</b> the #http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen <br>
The film begins with several ice harvesters collecting ice out in the cold regions of the l<b>and</b> ("Frozen Heart"). <br>
Among them is an 8-year-old boy named Kristoff with his reindeer calf Sven. <br>
After collecting enough ice, the harvesters depart to the kingdom of Arend<b>el</b>le late at night. <br>
At the same time, 5-year-old Princess Anna (Livvy Stubenrauch) wakes her <b>el</b>der 8-year-old sister Princess <b>El</b>sa (Eva B<b>el</b>la) to play. <br>
<b>El</b>sa playfully brushed her sister off until it was suggested they build a snowman, to which <b>El</b>sa d<b>el</b>ightfully agrees. <br>
The sisters head into the castle's throne room <b>and</b> create a winter fi<b>el</b>d of snow using <b>El</b>sa's snow magic, enjoying their time with plenty of merriment. <br>
They build a snowman, who <b>El</b>sa names Olaf, that likes warm hugs. <br>
When <b>El</b>sa, however, hits Anna with her powers in an attempt to save her little sister <b>from</b> falling, the royal family journeys to the legendary Valley of the Living Rock to seek the h<b>el</b>p of trolls who remove the magic <b>from</b> Anna along with her memory of her sister's magic ability. <br>
<b>El</b>sa is then ostracized <b>from</b> everyone, including Anna, in order to protect her <b>from</b> the world until she can learn to control her powers, leaving both sisters distraught <b>and</b> lon<b>el</b>y. <br>
Their despair only escalates when their parents die 10 years later, after they go on a ship to sail somewhere when a storm erupts with a wave capsizing the ship. <br>
Three years later, it is the day of <b>El</b>sa's (Idina Menz<b>el</b>) coronation ceremony. <br>
Dignitaries <b>from</b> around the world are coming to visit, including the Duke of Wes<b>el</b>ton (Alan Tudyk) who wants to run Arend<b>el</b>le's profits dry. <br>
Nobody is more excited than Anna (Kristen B<b>el</b>l), as they are finally opening the gates to the kingdom. <br>
She is happy to see other people, <b>and</b> hopes for the possibility of meeting that special someone, but <b>El</b>sa is still concerned about trying to control her powers ("For the First Time in Forever"). <br>
As she strolls out onto the streets, she bumps into a horse who happens to b<b>el</b>ong to the charming <b>and</b> h<b>and</b>some Prince Hans (Santino Fontana) of the Southern Isles. <br>
Though angered at first by the clumsiness of the stranger, Anna is attracted by Hans's appearance <b>and</b> looks once she lays his eyes on him. <br>
The coronation goes off without a hitch despite <b>El</b>sa's fears, <b>and</b> she even takes time to connect with her sister at the party. <br>
Anna's interaction with her sister brings quite the d<b>el</b>ightful fe<b>el</b>ing to the princess, flustered at first, as w<b>el</b>l as seeing <b>El</b>sa so happy instead of serious <b>and</b> preserved boosts Anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. <br>
They're interrupted afterwards by their steward Kai introducing the snide Duke of Wes<b>el</b>ton, who offers <b>El</b>sa her first dance as queen. <br>
<b>El</b>sa polit<b>el</b>y declines the offer but instead playfully volunteers Anna, much to the Duke's d<b>el</b>ight noneth<b>el</b>ess, <b>and</b> the two head off into a comical dance scene. <br>
<b>El</b>sa couldn't hold back a chuckle in during which she sees Anna innocently flustered by the Duke's over-the-top dancing skills. <br>
This causes Anna to fe<b>el</b> just as whimsical about the entire matter, for seeing <b>El</b>sa in such a state hasn't been a sight for years. <br>
Anna returns by <b>El</b>sa's side afterwards, commenting on how w<b>el</b>l things have been going through the day, <b>and</b> expresses her wishes to have things the way they were that night all the time. <br>
<b>El</b>sa's smile unfortunat<b>el</b>y fades away <b>and</b> she r<b>el</b>uctantly denies Anna's wishes all at once, though fails to explain why so. <br>
Anna <b>and</b> Hans then sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. <br>
The romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date ("Love is an Open Door"), with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. <br>
Hans, during their time together, learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently dev<b>el</b>oping a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids. <br>
Hans openly r<b>el</b>ates to this, only furthering Anna's connection with him. <br>
Hans then promises to never shut Anna out unlike <b>El</b>sa, much to the princess' absolute joy. <br>
By the end of their tour throughout the kingdom, Hans proposes right on the spot to which Anna immediat<b>el</b>y accepts. <br>
The two head back the ballroom, where Anna asks for <b>El</b>sa's blessing on the marriage. <br>
<b>El</b>sa's baffled by the shocking news, but Anna <b>and</b> Hans couldn't appear more excited going on to ramble about the wedding arrangements. <br>
<b>El</b>sa ceases the sudden rambling by denying the marriage, much to Anna's heartbreak. <br>
The queen asks to speak to Anna alone in private, lik<b>el</b>y to finally confess her abilities <b>and</b> why it's not wise to marry a total stranger without causing a scene that would sur<b>el</b>y get her true magical nature exposed, but the younger princess refuses any private conversation, stating whatever <b>El</b>sa has to say can be said to both her <b>and</b> Hans. <br>
<b>El</b>sa, becoming frustrated, outright forbids Anna of marrying someone she just met, indirectly t<b>el</b>ling the princess she knows nothing about true love. <br>
This causes Anna to hiss back, t<b>el</b>ling <b>El</b>sa all she knows is how to shut people out. <br>
Although <b>El</b>sa is visibly hurt by this, she continues to refuse with the argument only worsening when she orders the guards to end the party <b>and</b> close the gates. <br>
<b>El</b>sa refuses to grant her blessing on the marriage, setting off an argument between the sisters <b>and</b> culminating in <b>El</b>sa's abilities being exposed to the party guests. <br>
Panicking, <b>El</b>sa flees with Anna in hot pursuit. <br>
As she becomes more stressed <b>and</b> panicked, the weather starts turning colder: snow begins to fall <b>and</b> <b>El</b>sa races across the fjord, freezing it with each step but turning the whole body of water into ice <b>and</b> trapping all the ships before spreading throughout the rest of the kingdom. <br>
Having fail to retrieve her, Anna <b>and</b> Hans return to the castle courtyard where the guests have gathered. <br>
The Duke of Wes<b>el</b>ton begins to panic as it eerily begins snowing, declaring they must take action <b>and</b> put an end to <b>El</b>sa's curse. <br>
Anna, however, refuses <b>and</b> volunteers to seek out <b>El</b>sa hers<b>el</b>f <b>and</b> make things right, fe<b>el</b>ing that it's her fault for pushing her. <br>
With Hans being left in charge of the kingdom, Anna heads off on her horse to begin her search for her sister. <br>
<b>El</b>sa makes it to the North Mountain where she laments her failure at keeping the powers contained but quickly becomes more <b>and</b> more at ease <b>and</b> r<b>el</b>axed, free to use her powers as she pleases (singing the song "Let It Go", creating a snowman (the same one she <b>and</b> Anna built when they were young), an ice castle <b>and</b> ice dress). <br>
While searching for <b>El</b>sa, Anna loses her horse in the process. <br>
She trav<b>el</b>s on foot until nightfall, where she finds hers<b>el</b>f at W<b>and</b>ering Oaken's Trading Post <b>and</b> Sauna. <br>
She asks the shop owner Oaken (Chris Williams) for winter boots <b>and</b> dresses. <br>
She makes small talk with him, then meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). <br>
Anna convinces Kristoff to take her to the North Mountain, where the source of the winter is coming <b>from</b>. <br>
They get attacked by wolves on their journey, causing Kristoff to lose his sled. <br>
They continue on foot, <b>and</b> meet Olaf (Josh Gad), the snowman <b>El</b>sa created, who seems to be alive. <br>
Olaf shares his dreams of experiencing summer ("In Summer"), <b>and</b> agrees to lead them to <b>El</b>sa's hideout. <br>
The gang make it to <b>El</b>sa's castle, where Anna <b>and</b> <b>El</b>sa reunite. <br>
While both are happy to see each other, <b>El</b>sa still harbors fears of wounding Anna once again. <br>
Despite Anna's promising to st<b>and</b> by her sister <b>and</b> h<b>el</b>p her, <b>El</b>sa only grows more agitated <b>and</b> nervous resulting in her magic flaring. <br>
This time, it strikes Anna in the heart. <br>
<b>El</b>sa, in desperation to get her sister to safety, creates a giant snow creature (that Olaf calls "Marshmallow") to throw them out. <br>
As revenge, Anna balls up a snowball <b>and</b> throws it at the giant beast. <br>
Though it left literally no damage whatsoever, the lack of respect was enough to infuriate Marshmallow <b>and</b> cause him to chase Anna, Kristoff <b>and</b> Olaf down the Northern Mountain <b>and</b> most lik<b>el</b>y <b>el</b>iminate them. <br>
Marshmallow manages to corner them at the edge of a cliff, though Kristoff immediat<b>el</b>y begins digging a snow anchor by using a rope to saf<b>el</b>y guide hims<b>el</b>f <b>and</b> Anna down the mountain to safety. <br>
Marshmallow, however, catches up to them, though Olaf tries to stop him. <br>
Marshmallow, annoyed, kicks Olaf over the cliff, <b>and</b> continues his chase for Anna <b>and</b> Kristoff. <br>
He pulls them up to his face by the rope, <b>and</b> orders them once more to never return. <br>
Just after, Anna grabs Kristoff's knife <b>and</b> cuts the rope. <br>
This sends the duo plummeting down, though they survive. <br>
With his mission to drive them away complete, Marshmallow returns to the ice palace. <br>
After they escaped the snow monster, Kristoff notices that Anna's hair is turning white. <br>
He takes them to seek h<b>el</b>p, to which he leads Anna (who is slowly freezing) to the trolls. <br>
A mix-up occurs, <b>and</b> the trolls insist Anna <b>and</b> Kristoff to get married ("Fixer Upper"). <br>
Anna collapses before the two can be wed by Gothi the Troll Priest, <b>and</b> Gr<b>and</b> Pabbie appears. <br>
According to him, only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart or <b>el</b>se Anna will freeze solid. <br>
Kristoff races back to Arend<b>el</b>le to get Anna to Hans, b<b>el</b>ieving true love's kiss will save her. <br>
Meanwhile, Hans, on a search for Anna after her horse returns to the kingdom without her, <b>and</b> the guards find the ice castle. <br>
The moment they come close enough, Marshmallow reveals hims<b>el</b>f <b>from</b> the form of snowy boulders in case more unwanted guests were to arrive jumps right into battle. <br>
The soldiers immediat<b>el</b>y attack the beast with their arrows, infuriating Marshmallow <b>and</b> causing his ultimate form to be unleashed. <br>
Marshmallow is able to hold most of the guards off. <br>
Hans, however, proves to be a fierce warrior hims<b>el</b>f, avoiding each of Marshmallow's attacks <b>and</b> eventually using his sword to slice the snow monster's leg off <b>and</b> cause him to lose balance <b>and</b> begin tumbling over to a large gorge. <br>
With Marshmallow wounded, Hans begins heading inside <b>El</b>sa's castle. <br>
Marshmallow, however, doesn't give up, giving one last swing in attempt to drag Hans down with him. <br>
Marshmallow unfortunat<b>el</b>y fails plummets down into the chasm b<b>el</b>ow, apparently to his death. <br>
While Hans battles Marshmallow, the Duke's men attack <b>El</b>sa. <br>
She fights back, nearly killing them both much to her own horror. <br>
Just as <b>El</b>sa was about to murder the two, Hans appears <b>and</b> stops her to say not to prove she's the monster they b<b>el</b>ieve she is. <br>
<b>El</b>sa settles down a bit at Hans' words, realizing the demon she was becoming <b>and</b> halts her magic. <br>
One of the soldiers, however, aims his arrow at <b>El</b>sa, still following the Duke's orders. <br>
Hans intervenes just as the soldier is about to shoot her,, causing the arrow to cut through <b>El</b>sa's ch<b>and</b><b>el</b>ier which then plummets towards the ground. <br>
<b>El</b>sa tries to escape the collision, but is knocked out in the process. <br>
Hans <b>and</b> the soldiers then capture her <b>and</b> head back to the kingdom. <br>
She wakes up shackled in a c<b>el</b>l back in Arend<b>el</b>le Castle. <br>
Hans pleads with her to undo the winter, but <b>El</b>sa replies that she can't due to the fact that she is unable to control her powers. <br>
Anna is returned to Hans, freezing more <b>and</b> more cold <b>and</b> sick by the minute. <br>
She t<b>el</b>ls Hans everything that has happened <b>and</b> hopes he will kiss her <b>and</b> break the curse. <br>
But he instead cru<b>el</b>ly reveals that he had been pretending to love her the whole time, as part of a fiendish plan to seize control of Arend<b>el</b>le's throne, because he is the youngest of thirteen brothers <b>and</b> will never reach the throne in his own kingdom. <br>
Anna tries to stop him, but she is far too weak. <br>
He puts the fire out to prevent Anna <b>from</b> getting any heat <b>and</b> warmth, <b>and</b> leaves Anna to freeze to death. <br>
Then he t<b>el</b>ls the Duke <b>and</b> the kingdom's officials what Anna told him, in addition of lying that he was too late to save her. <br>
He also pretends to grieve for her, <b>and</b> sentences <b>El</b>sa to death as part of his plan. <br>
<b>El</b>sa escapes <b>from</b> prison when she learns Hans' means to have her executed for treason, <b>and</b> heads out into the blizzard on the fjord. <br>
Meanwhile, Anna's curse becomes stronger with her death process nearly complete. <br>
When Olaf arrives, he finds Anna in the library on the ground <b>and</b> quickly dying. <br>
Olaf comes to Anna's rescue, <b>and</b> starts a fire to keep the princess warm. <br>
Olaf then asks what happened with the true love's kiss <b>from</b> Hans, to which Anna reveals his treachery <b>and</b> Hans never loved her. <br>
Fearing he'll m<b>el</b>t, Anna t<b>el</b>ls Olaf to leave. <br>
Not wanting to ab<b>and</b>on his friend, the snowman stays by her side <b>and</b> nearly m<b>el</b>ts during this time. <br>
Anna brokenheartedly t<b>el</b>ls Olaf that she doesn't even know what love is anymore. <br>
Olaf replies by t<b>el</b>ling Anna that love is putting someone <b>el</b>se before yours<b>el</b>f, using Kristoff as an example. <br>
This reveals Kristoff's true fe<b>el</b>ings to Anna, much to the princess' surprise. <br>
Suddenly, the library's window bursts open due to the strong winter winds. <br>
Olaf rushes to close it, but he then notices Kristoff <b>and</b> Sven rushing back to the castle. <br>
Knowing Kristoff is truly the one that loves Anna, the two try to head out to meet him. <br>
Olaf then aids the dying princess out of the castle <b>and</b> into the fjords. <br>
The two then trav<b>el</b> together out on the fjord to find him, where he is racing back to the kingdom. <br>
With a sword at h<b>and</b>, Hans is prepared to slay the queen. <br>
Hans eventually stumbles upon her, t<b>el</b>ling her that she can't escape all the horrible things she's already done. <br>
<b>El</b>sa pleads for mercy, still b<b>el</b>ieving Hans to be a benevolent prince, <b>and</b> asks him to take care of her sister for her. <br>
Hans cuts <b>El</b>sa off, <b>and</b> t<b>el</b>ls her that Anna is dead because of her. <br>
Devastated by the horrific news, <b>El</b>sa breaks down in tears. <br>
In <b>El</b>sa's despair, the storm immediat<b>el</b>y stops. <br>
This then gives Kristoff <b>and</b> Anna the chance to reach each other. <br>
But at that moment, Anna hears a sword being drawn a short distance away. <br>
In horror, Anna sees that Hans is about to kill her sister. <br>
Anna must choose to save hers<b>el</b>f or her sister, which is only seconds away. <br>
After one last look at Kristoff, she makes her decision to save <b>El</b>sa <b>and</b> throw hers<b>el</b>f between <b>El</b>sa <b>and</b> Hans; she freezes solid just as Hans' sword hits her instead of <b>El</b>sa, also causing Hans to be brutally knocked out unconscious. <br>
<b>El</b>sa, after a few moments of despair, sees that her sister has thawed <b>and</b> come back to life because she sacrificed hers<b>el</b>f to save her sister, constituting an act of true love which Olaf first realizes. <br>
<b>El</b>sa realizes that love is the key to controlling her powers, <b>and</b> thaws the kingdom. <br>
Olaf, overjoyed, smiles with glee, but quickly m<b>el</b>ts due to the summer heat. <br>
<b>El</b>sa restores him <b>and</b> gives him a small flurry cloud to hover over his body <b>and</b> keep him complet<b>el</b>y cool, finally allowing the snowman to live his dream of experiencing summer <b>and</b> all its wonders. <br>
When Hans awakens several moments later, he finds Arend<b>el</b>le thawed <b>and</b> peace restored. <br>
When Kristoff attempted to confront Hans for trying to kill the two sisters, <b>El</b>sa seems touched by Kristoff's protectiveness over her <b>and</b> Anna. <br>
Anna, however, decides to confront him instead. <br>
Anna then approaches the manipulative prince, which the sight of Anna alive <b>and</b> w<b>el</b>l confuses Hans <b>and</b> prompts him to ask how she'd survive the frozen heart curse. <br>
Eventually, Anna berates Hans by t<b>el</b>ling him he's the only one around here with the frozen heart <b>and</b> turns her back at him much to Hans' disb<b>el</b>ief. <br>
Out of fury, the princess turns around <b>and</b> punches him in the face off the ship they were aboard a few seconds later. <br>
Anna <b>and</b> <b>El</b>sa then hug, with their friendship restored stronger than ever. <br>
As the sisters hug, Anna looks lovingly towards Kristoff. <br>
Exposed as the manipulating liar he is, Hans is then arrested <b>and</b> deported back to his own kingdom to face punishment <b>from</b> his 12 older brothers for his deeds. <br>
<b>El</b>sa additionally cuts off all trade with Wes<b>el</b>ton. <br>
The Duke tries to claim that he was innocent <b>and</b> a victim of fear. <br>
But to no avail, he <b>and</b> his thugs are sent back to Wes<b>el</b>ton. <br>
He is then heard insisting that the town is not named "Weas<b>el</b> Town" after being mispronounced once again, though purpos<b>el</b>y by Kai to annoy him. <br>
Anna gives Kristoff a new sled sometime later, <b>and</b> reveals that <b>El</b>sa has named him the Official Ice Master for the kingdom <b>and</b> so he can be with Anna. <br>
The two then finally share a kiss. <br>
<b>El</b>sa creates an ice rink in one of the castle courtyards <b>and</b> promises to never shut the castle gates again, while gifting Anna with a pair of ice skates (made out of ice). <br>
Anna is d<b>el</b>ighted, but t<b>el</b>ls <b>El</b>sa she can't skate. <br>
<b>El</b>sa h<b>el</b>ps her, who is later joined by Olaf. <br>
The movie ends with everyone in Arend<b>el</b>le skating, making the most of <b>El</b>sa's ice rink. <br>
It is revealed after the credits that Marshmallow had survived along with a new made leg. <br>
He is seen limping back into the castle, where all he finds is <b>El</b>sa's old crown. <br>
The monster looks around for a moment, <b>and</b> smiles. <br>
Then, pleasing his inner princess, Marshmallow happily crowns hims<b>el</b>f ruler of the castle while going back to his normal <b>and</b> peaceful form smiling <b>and</b> letting out a happy sigh, happily continuing his life in the North Mountains. <br>
